# Model Evaluation

This repository provides tools, scripts, and documentation for evaluating machine learning models. It is designed for data scientists and machine learning engineers who want a streamlined way to assess and compare the performance of different models across various datasets and tasks.

## Features

- **Metric Calculation**: Supports common evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
- **Visualization**: Generate plots such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.
- **Easy Integration**: Modular design for easy integration into existing ML pipelines.
- **Dataset Support**: Handles both classification and regression tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Install dependencies with:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
